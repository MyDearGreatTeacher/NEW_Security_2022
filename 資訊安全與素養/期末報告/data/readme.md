We can get into the Administrator's computer with a browser exploit.
But first, we need to figure out what browser they're using.
Perhaps this information is located in a network packet capture we took: data3.pcap.
Enter the browser and version as "BrowserName BrowserVersion".

NOTE: We're just looking for up to 3 levels of subversions for the browser version 
(ie. Version 1.2.3 for Version 1.2.3.4) and ignore any 0th subversions (ie. 1.2 for 1.2.0)

Hint:

Where can we find information on the browser in networking data?
Maybe try reading up on user-agent strings.
